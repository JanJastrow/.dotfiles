# .dotfiles

I moved from ```bash``` to ```zsh``` as my daily-driver a few years ago.  
Since then I have collected some neat settings, scripts, aliases and other niceties.

## Install

Clone repo do your user directory

```~/.dotfiles```

and run ```./install.sh```

## Explanation of files

- zsh/settings  
  Set up the zsh environment
- zsh/env  
  Add different folders with binaries to your $PATH and load the rest of my environment
- zsh/alias  
  You guessed it
- zsh/bindings  
  Custom key bindings, but not really in use at the moment
- zsh/scripts  
  Small custom shell scripts
- zsh/ffmpeg  
  FFmpeg helper scripts
- zsh/device-specific  
  Set settings/alias/etc only for this device and don't commit them
